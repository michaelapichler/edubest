**Best Practices for Online Education**

This page has been created to gather ideas for a perfect online education where a teacher 
typically has 5 < x < 100 Students.

Please contribute to this either 
* via pull request
* via email (can be found at the ahthors homepage here http://edlich.de)
* or you can also request for write permission on this repository.

Currently - as you can see in the files section - the work is split into:

* `Documents`
* `Asynchronous stuff`
* `Synchronous stuff`
* `Problems`

This work resulted partially from 10+ years of experience in the vfh.de group.

Please contribute!
Thanks
Stefan Edlich

P.S.: The docs are currently in german but will be translated!
